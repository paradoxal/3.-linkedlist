<p>Before attempting this exercise, you must solve the earlier programming
exercises of this problem set as you will have to base this solution
on the data structures implemented by yourself in earlier exercises.
You will also need the file <tt class="docutils literal">reverseobjects.py</tt> included in the materials
package for the linked list exercise.</p>
<p>Implement the function <tt class="docutils literal">reverseObjects(objs)</tt>, which reverses
the sequence of objects given to it. In your solution, use the stack implementation
developed in the previous exercise.</p>
