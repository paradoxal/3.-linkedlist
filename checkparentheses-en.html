<p>Before attempting this exercise, you must solve the earlier programming
exercises of this problem set where you implemented a linked list and a
stack as you will have to use these structures in this solution.
You will also need the file <tt class="docutils literal">checkparentheses.py</tt> included in the materials
package for the linked list exercise.</p>
<p>Into the file <tt class="docutils literal">checkparentheses.py</tt> implement a function
that returns a boolean value (<tt class="docutils literal">True</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">False</tt>) indicating
whether parentheses in a string given to the function are
correctly ordered.</p>
<p>There are a few input examples along with corresponding correct output
in the file. Those should clear out confusion on what exactly is the
task.</p>
<p>Hint: The entire solution file need not be longer than 30 lines.</p>
