<p>Download and familiarize yourself with
<a class="reference external" href="https://trak.cs.hut.fi/static/material/linkedlist.zip">this materials package.</a></p>
<p>The materials package contains files related to other exercises in this
week's exercise set. Ignore the other files for now while focusing on the
file <tt class="docutils literal">linkedlist.py</tt>.</p>
<p>Using that file as a starting point, implement a doubly linked list.
Most of the structure is already defined, but there
are a few unimplemented methods that require your attention.</p>
<p>Use dedicated guardian nodes that constitute the very front and very
end of the list. You might name them for example <tt class="docutils literal">h</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">head</tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal">z</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">tail</tt>. The list should always have these two nodes, and it
should be considered empty, when these two are the only nodes in it.
They should not contain any data inserted by the user.</p>
<p>Do not use any of Python's standard data structures (<tt class="docutils literal">list</tt>,
<tt class="docutils literal">dict</tt>, ...).
Using them in a solution will be considered cheating.</p>
